# Classification-of-Food-Images-Using-Deep-Learning-and-CNN
The main objective of the project is to build a Multi-Class Image Classifier to identify the food category, given an image of food. In this project we have applied theoretical knowledge of machine learning to be precise deep learning and convolutional neural network(CNN) to develop a system to classifiy a particular image of a food into a certain class to which it belongs. We used two different neural network architectures in the project namely Inception V3 and VGG-16. The different models provide different accuracy rates. And then after properly analyzing we choose the model with highest accuracy rates for classification of images.
